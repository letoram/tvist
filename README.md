Video feed subregion analysis tool for Arcan

This is a simple tool that was initially created for some 
computer vision based monitoring where the need was to 
specify regions in a video feed that should be tracked,
then configure how these regions should be filtered and analysed.

The idea turned out to be useful for other weird stuff,
some that are currently being explored is "airsynth" where
each region is associated with sample playback and
"robopin" looking into creating a self-playing pinball machine
triggers are used to track ball location).
